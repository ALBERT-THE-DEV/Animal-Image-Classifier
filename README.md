# Animal-Image-Classifier (FastAI)

This project showcases an animal image classifier web application that classifies images of animals into 10 categories using a ResNet34 model trained with FastAI. User uploads an image to get predictions with confidence scores.

Project Overview
----------------
The dataset used is Animals-10 from Kaggle, containing images of 10 animal classes: Dog, Cat, Horse, Elephant, Butterfly, Chicken, Cow, Sheep, Spider, and Squirrel. The model uses transfer learning on ResNet34 pretrained on ImageNet and achieves approximately 95â€“98% validation accuracy. Users can upload an image via the Streamlit app, which predicts the animal class along with confidence scores.
